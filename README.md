# WakeTechCapstone
Capstone project for Wake Tech


The point of this project was to develop an application that would act as a file explorer with a database for indexing.
This was a team project where I worked with 5 other people. I worked as the main developer and as a database engineer.

I also created all of the UML shown in this repository.
